# Need to specify the framework explicitly because we don't have
# an app.psgi file.  It is called bugzilla/psgi, and it will only
# be created during post-staging.
framework: perl

# CGI::Emulate::PSGI has a bug that prevents it to work with uWSGI:
#   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=72684
# So we are going to run Bugzilla under plackup instead for now:
processes:
  web: (plackup --port $VCAP_APP_PORT)
  # Once the bug is fixed the web command should be:
  #  web: (cd bugzilla && $PROCESSES_WEB)

  post-staging: perl setup.pl
